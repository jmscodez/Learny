        2.  **Tell a Story:** Structure the lesson with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Create a narrative arc.
        3.  **Focus on Surprising Details:** Uncover fascinating facts or perspectives that the average person might not know.
        4.  **Vary Interactivity:** Use a mix of screen types to keep the user engaged and active.

        Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with a single key, "screens".
        The value of "screens" is an array of \(screenCount) screen objects. Each object must have a "type" and a "payload".

        **Screen Types & How To Use Them Effectively:**

        1.  `"type": "title"`
            -   `"payload": { "title": String, "subtitle": String (optional), "hook": String }`
            -   **Usage:** The hook must be a fascinating, non-obvious question that sparks immediate curiosity.

        2.  `"type": "info"`
            -   `"payload": { "text": String }`
            -   **Usage:** Present a single, powerful idea or fact. Use it to introduce a key person, event, or concept with specific details.

        3.  `"type": "tapToReveal"`
            -   `"payload": { "question": String, "answer": String }`
            -   **Usage:** Pose a "What happened next?" or "What was the result?" style question. The answer should be a surprising or impactful outcome.

        4.  `"type": "multipleChoice"`
            -   `"payload": { "question": String, "options": [String], "correctIndex": Int, "explanation": String }`
            -   **Usage:** Test understanding with 3-4 options. The explanation should clarify why the answer is correct and why others are wrong.

        5.  `"type": "trueFalse"`
            -   `"payload": { "statement": String, "isTrue": Bool, "explanation": String }`
            -   **Usage:** Present a statement that challenges common assumptions or tests specific facts. Great for misconceptions.

        6.  `"type": "dragToOrder"`
            -   `"payload": { "instruction": String, "items": [String], "correctOrder": [Int] }`
            -   **Usage:** Have users arrange events chronologically, steps in a process, or items by importance. Items should be meaningful and specific.

        7.  `"type": "cardSort"`
            -   `"payload": { "instruction": String, "categories": [String], "cards": [{ "text": String, "correctCategoryIndex": Int }] }`
            -   **Usage:** Sort concepts, people, or examples into categories. Great for classification and understanding relationships.

        8.  `"type": "dialogue"`
            -   `"payload": { "lines": [{ "speaker": String, "message": String }] }`
            -   **Usage:** Create a short, impactful exchange between real, named individuals. It could be a quote or a simulated conversation that reveals different perspectives.

        9.  `"type": "matching"`
            -   `"payload": { "pairs": [{ "term": String, "definition": String }] }`

Each question must have 4 options, be contextual to the lesson, and test comprehension rather than memorization. Students need 4 out of 5 correct to pass. Include explanations for correct answers where helpful.

        Generate a sequence of \(screenCount) screens for the lesson "\(lessonTitle)".
        Start with a "title" screen.
        End with a "quiz" screen.
